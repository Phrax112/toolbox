This repository contains useful utilities for a q programming language project

These are all helper scripts which have been left deliberately simple in order to maximise their ease of integration for any specific project. Therefore, while there may be enhancements which would be useful in certain circumstances they have been left to the implementer to add on a per-project basis.
